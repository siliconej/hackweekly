# Week 1: Java implementation of PDF Signature verification

I notice that there's lack of coherent explanation of how simple PDF digital
signature is verified.  So I explored in last several days and implemented
my own PDF signature verifier.  I will write a blogpost in the near future
to explain what were the interesting blockers and issues I had during this
adventure.

The building and testing process is self-explanatory, simply on any mainstream
OS with a reasonable recent JDK installed and gnumake installed.

And just type "make", good luck, and I hope that my code could be helpful
to everyone in the github community.

Happy Hacking,
