# Week1: Java implementation of PDF Signature verification

I notice that there's lack of coherent explanation of how simple PDF digital
signature is verified.  So I explored in last several days and implemented
my own PDF signature verifier.  I will write a blogpost in the near future
to explain what were the interest blockers and issues I had during this
adventure.
